    "text": "A Budding Statistician\n\nAbout me\nI am currently a graduate student at the Master’s programme ‘Methodology and Statistics’ at Utrecht University, finalising my thesis under the guidance of Dr. Dave Hessen in the field of Item Response Theory. Although interested in all of Statistics, I am most enthusiastic about the more theoretical and mathematical side of the field. In addition, I’m incredibly passionate about the education and its quality, which is why I joined the Programme Advisory Committee and Educational Commitee to try and improve the quality of the programme. Besides that, I believe that all Science should be Open Science in order to better develop the reliability and trustworthiness of Science as a whole.\nMy aims for the near future correspond to these values, and that is why I wish to further develop myself in the field of Statistics by entering the academic world and to personally start teaching in the field. Therefore, I am fervently searching for a fitting PhD position in the field starting September 2023.\nFor more detailed information about my background and education, feel free to check out my LinkedIn and/or CV.\n\n\nExperience in the field\nAlthough I currently have no published research (subject to change once my MSc thesis is finished in a few months), my statistical experiences include: (a) a confirmatory and exploratory meta-analysis of the effect of institutions in Social Dilemmas, (b) programming my own Gibbs and Metropolis-Hastings sampler, (c) programming several simulation studies investigating new the performance of fit indices and goodness-of-fit tests, (d) coding, interpreting and evaluating different types of multilevel models, and much more! For an overview of some of my programming, check out my GitHub.\n\n\nContact\nTo contact me, you can email me at: n.l.vangerwen@uu.nl.\n\n This site was made using Quarto."
